        <p>Our restaurant began on the year of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, 1969!<br>
            Our owner, rugged and tough as he was, Tim Timmy was but a poor fisher at the time trying to make himself known to the world. One day when walking along the coast of the Atlantis border and after saving up enough money to go to the local café in the area he knew that this is the career he wanted to pursue.<br>
            After saving the funds for years at the docks he was able to purchase a building off the coast of Atlantis to start his own café. Though most would only see it as a rundown shack, after much love, care, and work Tim brought the café up to speed to at least serve the food and service he was planning on selling.<br>
            Tim brought to the café some of his mothers and his own favorite recipes and brought his friend along, Jim Jimmy, as the first chef of the restaurant. Together they ran the café for years and it was an instant success among the locals of the province. <br>After reinvesting the capital gained in the restaurant over the years they have added on dozens of members to the café’s team and overhauled the atmosphere and size of the restaurant to make it what it looks like today. With new faces, this also led to the expansion of our menu to include the delicacies it has today. Through hard effort and a dream to persevere, Tim made himself a name in ever-growing industry here on the Atlantis coast.</p>
